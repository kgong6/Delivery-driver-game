# delivery-driver-game

This is my very first game made in Unity. 

I'm absolutely obsessed with adventure RPGs and the aesthetics of pixel art (ie. Undertale/Deltarune, among others :) ). 

I hope to make this game really cosy, and calming -- and evoke hint of nostalgia.

In this project, you control a little delivery car, and deliver the respective food/little potions to the corresponding little animal villagers in a neighbourhood.

I wanted to make this 2d pixel art game to learn all the basic fundamentals of Unity. After this project, I aim to include physics in my next game.
